## Abstract

Starting from the fact that eukaryotic organisms possess a quantity of repeatable DNA derived from transposable elements and that their study has provided significant information about evolution and the origin of organisms, it was decided to study the genome of the flatworm Taenia solium, whose genome is already known, in order to identify repeatable elements within it. Analyses of open reading frames, phylogenetic trees and alignments, among others, allowed for important information to be extracted about these elements. This Final Course Project describes the Scientific Initiation activity carried out during the year 2018 under the guidance of Professor Ricardo de Marco at the University of Sao Paulo.
